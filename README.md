# HandProthesis
In this project the developments for feedback of myoelectric prostheses. Since the prostheses themselves are not available, we simulated them using Unity3D

For some reason Unity decided that this project is based on version 2022.3.11f1

The project uses 3D models of a hand and some simple objects like a cube or a pyramid created in Blender

Realised at this step are:
<ul>
<li>Moving the hand in space and rotating it</li>
<li>Animations of finger bending (in any combination)</li>
<li>Additional fist animation</li>
<li>Interaction with objects and the ability to lift/move them around the scene</li>
<li>Additional camera</li>
<li>Status screen highlighting which area of the hand the object is interacting with (based on additional triggers)</li>
</ul>
